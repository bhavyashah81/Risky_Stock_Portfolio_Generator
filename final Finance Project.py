# After finding the standard deviation of each sector, we decided to use the sector with the highest standard deviation as a foundation for our portfolio, then built the rest of the portfolio around that sector. To elaborate, we first included all the stocks from the sector with the highest standard deviation in the portfolio, as it should be the sector with the riskiest stocks. Furthermore, since all the stocks are from the same sector, they should be fairly positively correlated. As a result, we will have a group of risky stocks that generally move in the same direction, so the risk of the overall portfolio will increase. Then, we found the correlation of all the sectors with each other, as shown above. We sorted the rest of the sectors by their correlation with the riskiest sector, from highest positive correlation to negative correlation.
# 
# Next, we added stocks from the most positively correlated sectors from the sorted list to the portfolio until we had 10 stocks in the portfolio. The result can be seen from the ticker_list dataframe below, where we include all the stocks from a sector before moving on to the next sector. This limits the amount of sectors we have in our portfolio, and since all the sectors are as positively correlated as possible, the amount of inter-industry diversification is limited as well. To reiterate, we tried to include the least amount of sectors in our portfolio as possible by including all the stocks from the riskiest sectors. As a result, our portfolio becomes more prone to risk that is specific to the industries that we have in our portfolio. Moreover, we selected the sectors that have the highest positive correlation with the riskiest sector, so the stocks in the portfolio will generally move in the same direction, further increasing risk. We decided to only have 10 stocks in our portfolio as we wanted to have the least amount of stocks as possible, to limit the amount of diversification. With less stocks in our portfolio, each stock will have a greater influence on the performance of the overall portfolio, thus increasing risk. In the case that we could not include an entire sector in our portfolio due to the limit of 10 stocks, the stocks with the highest standard deviation were added to our portfolio, maximizing the risk of the portfolio.

# After deciding on the 10 stocks for our portfolio, we needed to decide on how much of the portfolio to allocate to each stock. In order to create the riskiest portfolio, we needed to invest most of our money into the least amount of stocks as possible. To accomplish this, we invested 35 percent of the portfolio in the stock from the riskiest sector with the highest standard deviation. As mentioned earlier, standard deviation is a direct measure of risk, so the stock with the highest standard deviation should be the riskiest. Then, we invested 25 percent in the stock that is the most positively correlated with the stock with the highest standard deviation, as shown above. By doing this, we would invest 25 percent of our money in the stock that is the most directly related to riskiest stock. We invested 25 percent of our money in this stock as it was the most we could, since we needed to invest at least 5000 dollars in each stock to meet the requirements. As a result, we have 60 percent of our portfolio allocated to the 2 riskiest stocks that are positively correlated to each other, and 5 percent of our portfolio in each of the 8 other stocks. By having 60 percent of our portfolio in 2 stocks, we allowed the returns of the portfolio to be primarily determined by 2 stocks. Hence, we greatly limited the amount of diversification by increasing exposure to the risk of the 2 stocks, which in turn, increases the risk of the portfolio. As for the 8 other stocks, if they are highly positively correlated with the first 2 stocks, then they will further increase the risk the portfolio. On the other hand, if they have a lower correlation with the first 2 stocks, it won't affect the risk of the portfolio by too much, as we only invested 5 percent in each of these stocks.
